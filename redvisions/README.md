redvisions is a cyberpunk-ish theme. inspiration for it came from astral throb's offworld mix, i just thought the artwork looked cool and immediately started 
searching for wallpapers of similar style. theme eventually developed into this. also credit to u/hisacro for the rofi theme, i had been using it previously for
almost a year now and only really thought to change the colors of the theme up until now.
